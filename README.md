## Problem Statement and Focus Area
> How might we make digital banking accessible for everyone
> Target audience: Seniors of today and tomorrow
> Designing for the current generation of seniors is important, in a rapidly advancing world where payments 
are going digital, ensuring that the digital gap does not widen is paramount. However, 
we do need to remember that one day the current generation will grow old too and therefore require 
assistance in our daily activities. Therefore, designing with the needs of the future generations in 
mind would help in laying the foundations for future proofing our solution.

## Our solution
A lite version of the OCBC digital banking app that contains features commonly used in day to day 
activites such as shopping, paying for essentials and transferring money to friends and loved ones.

## Features 
### Magnifying glass
- Enlarges selected sections of the page to improve text visibility, allowing users to read easily,
improving user experience as users will be able to have a clearer understanding without the need to squint.

### Text to speech
- Selectively reads out clicked words that are non-sensitive. Addresses problems of users who have
vision issues 

### Speech to Text
- Minimises the need for specific handmovements for typing, allowing users to talk to the app to
execute certain commands for certain features such as Pay Now, to navigate around the app, and to 
input fields. 

### Simulation for iBanking Services
- Allows users to gain familiarity with using iBanking services through step-by-step walkthroughs
that mimic the actual service. This alleviates any potential fears of mistakes that the user might
make and result in a loss of savings because the simulation allows the users to practice indefinitely
and provides a form of recap when in doubt.

### FAQ section
- Provides users with answers to commonly asked questions about the app.

### Video Call with support staff
- Provides a human touch to customer support issues.
- Share screen function allows users to easily show their problems to support staff, without needing
to describe and having to guess the issue over a voice call via the hotline. It increases efficiency 
as the problem can be quickly identified and resolved.
- Benefits persons with mobility issues as it can be an alternative to going to a physical branch 
counter to get their issues resolved.
